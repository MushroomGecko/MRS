# MRS
A project for my CMSC 668 class at Univeristy of Maryland, Baltimore County, MRS is a Movie Recommendation System that tailors specifically to your movie interests. Just sign up, search for some movies, select whether you like or dislike them, and select the option "Show Me My Movie!"

To start MRS, just run `python Webserver.py` and MRS does the rest! MRS is hosted on port 25565 and depends on Flask, Flask-Sock, os, werkzeug, json, hashlib, pymongo, pandas, requests, BeautifulSoup4 (bs4), unidecode, and sklearn.

The default user is "user1" and the password is "12345".
